    The traditional way of assigning event handlers in JavaScript is to assign a function to an event han-
    dler property. This was the event handler assignment method introduced in the fourth generation of
    web browsers, and it still remains in all modern browsers because of its simplicity and cross-browser
    support. To assign an event handler using JavaScript, you must first retrieve a reference to the object
    to act on.

  <button id="myBtn">Click Me!</button>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    let btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
    /*
    Note
    that the event handler isnâ€™t assigned until this code is run, so if the code appears after the code for
    the button in the page, there may be an amount of time during which the button will do nothing
    when clicked.
    */
    btn.onclick = function() {
      console.log("Clicked");
      // this is equivalent to element
      // console.log(this.id);
    }

    // remove event handler
    btn.onclick = function(){
      console.log(event.type);
    }
  </script>
